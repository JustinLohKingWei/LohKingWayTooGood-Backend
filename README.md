# LohKingWayTooGood-Backend

Part of the MERN stack of the [lohkingwaytoogood](https://github.com/JustinLohKingWei/LohKingWayTooGood) portfolio application.

The application is written to showcase my skills in developing a MERN Fullstack application. I understand that a MERN stack is not required for a simple portfolio website, and this architecture is simply a method for developing additional experience in the MERN technologies.

## Features

The application features responsive mobile screen sizing, simple framer motion animations as component transitions, in order to properly showcase my relevant skills and abilities.
